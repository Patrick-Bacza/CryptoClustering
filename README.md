# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, I clustered Crypto currency pricing data using the K-Means algorithm in two different ways and then compared the results. First, The pricing data consisted of changes in price over different intervals such as 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 60 days , 200 days and one year. Since each coin has drastically different valuations and price changes, the data had to be scaled in order to better compare the coins. This was done by using the StandardScaler class in Python. Second, clusters were created via K-means using the original data. Then, prinicpal component analysis was run on the data to create three features using the original features and subsequently, K-means was then run on the new PCA features. Afterwards, the calinski harabasz score was run on both K-means models which shows the model for the PCA features was better than the model run on the original features. After studying the graphs, one will come to the conclusion that the clusters generated using the PCA features are easier to interperate and make more sense than the clusters created using the original features. The challenge with the PCA clusters will be understanding what each PCA feature means.
